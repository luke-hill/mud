  description: The home of many of the men of the village of Newtown. The Newtown
    Pub offers its patrons a chance to sitdown, relax and rest your weary bones.
  advanced_description: The Fire is roaring, you hear chatter from the local villagers
    (What few reside here), about exploits in the neighbouring villages. The Barkeep
    begins to give you an angry look, then he asks you to leave as you're not spending
    Gold!

  description: The streets of Newtown are fairly quiet, as you'd expect from this
    remote area. You notice a side-path that leads to what looks like a Residential
    Area.
  advanced_description: Cobbled with primitive cut stone, and put together many years
    ago, these streets look like they've seen better times. The signs for the once
    active market scene are now worn, you can vaguely make out a sign for "Draz'ghun"
    the Potion Salesman.

    a small selection of potions from Draz'ghuns famed brewing.
  advanced_description: You look around and ask the Vendor for the Owner, who simply
    remarks that he's away on his adventures. The bottles on the shelves seem dirty,
    but you're told that the look is purely designed that way... To appeal to Travellers.
